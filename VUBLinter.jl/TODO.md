### This is a backlog (TODOs) as of 22/08/2024
- Implement a first batch of actual (10-20) lints; perhaps based on the [Google data linter](http://learningsys.org/nips17/assets/papers/paper_19.pdf)
- CLI interface
- support for some datasets/formats
- Documentation using Documenter.jl (perhaps man page as well)
- Python API (and pandas etc support)
- config support (data schema, options, code related options) i.e. parsing, default options, description etc
- disabling of linters: config, inline i.e. comment, CL
